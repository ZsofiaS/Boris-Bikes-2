# Boris Bikes

#### Week 1 afternoon pairing challenge

This is a program that emulates all the docking stations, bikes and infrastructure (repair staff and so on) required to create a new bike system planned by Transport for London. It has been built with test-driven development, using Ruby and RSpec.

#### To run the tests:
* Clone this repo
* Install the rspec gem
```
gem install rspec
```
* Open the terminal, navigate to the folder, and run:
```
rspec
```
